Hi, I'm Tomaz Fernandes. I'm a software engineer who enjoys building reliable, scalable systems with Spring Boot, AWS, and Kubernetes.

This blog is where I share technical deep dives, practical examples, and lessons learned from building production systems. Every post is backed by runnable code in the [examples](/examples/) section.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomazfernandes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaz-fernandes/).
